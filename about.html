    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I've often thought I could write my life history through the recipes I've collected. We didn't have a lot of money when I was young. We didn't celebrate Birthdays and Holidays with extravagance, but Mom always served us good food. I remember Mom's Banana Cake and German Chocolate Cake being the cakes all of us kids asked for on our Birthday</p>
    <p>On hot summer days, Mom would make a batch of Homemade Pineapple Ice Cream and we would take turns sitting on the mixer and then turning the crank until it was frozen. The six of us would fight over who got the beater and lick it clean.   </p>
    <p>On special occasions, Mom would make Yeast Doughnuts. I remember Mom frying them in Crisco and us dredging them in granulated sugar.    </p>
    <p>I could never forget Mom's Potato Salad. This salad is a treasured family favorite and the most unique I have ever tasted. Mom made this salad when I was a kid; it was always a treat and no recipe was ever used. Part of the preparation was a taste test after the salad had time to mellow. We learned to decide what the salad needed by taste. I picked up Mom's technique and never gave measurement much thought until I started thinking about sharing the recipe with my kids and others. With time and testing, I have put Mom's recipe on paper for all to enjoy.

    <p>The first praise I remember receiving as a child, was in the kitchen. I could mix, bake and clean up a batch of Chocolate Chip Cookies in 30 minutes.</p>
    <p>In my High School Home Economics class I was in Heaven. I found everything I was taught very interesting and I soaked it all in. I got the recipe for Beef and Rice Casserole in that class. Lane and I ate it a lot when we were first married.</p>
    <p>For our trip home to California from BYU for Lane to meet my family, I made a big batch of Butterscotch Brownies. We, of course, were both nervous and over the 16 hour drive we ate them until we were both sick. As a result, I haven't eaten them much since, but they are wonderful and rich and my kids love them.</p>
    <p>When Lane and I were first married and money was tight, I found recipes that were yummy but still easy on our budget like Scalloped Tuna.</p>
    <p>When the kids were young and I had lots of energy, I learned to preserve Sweet Pickles from a little book I had and made them faithfully each summer for many years. I also picked up several recipes that are still favorites like Jello Cheesecake, Bran Muffins and Twist Dish.</p>
    <p>It took lots of practice and adjustments as we moved to different altitudes, but I think I've got wheat bread perfected. I love to make dinner rolls, crescents rolls and sweet rolls. Another great cook taught me to make her tarts and pull apart rolls. I made the tarts for Rob and Shad's Wedding Reception.</p>
    <p>Now that the kids are grown and gone, I have become passionate about good recipes. I have spent a lot of time finding the perfect ribs recipe, like Nanny's Kickâ€™n Ribs and Steak Strips En Brochette. I have also polished my best cookie recipes because that's my job now, I'm a Grandma.</p>
    <p>The 4th of July Parade wouldn't be the same without Caramel Corn. Ali, Jeni and Sheli come to help Nanny make the Caramel Corn. It must be taste tested every time we take it out to stir it. We have fun.</p>
    <p>I am grateful to have been able to pass some of my knowledge and passion for cooking onto my Children and Grandchildren. The best times spent are those around the dinner table talking, laughing, reminiscing and making new memories. I hope you will enjoy the recipes I have collected.</p>
    <p>Love: Nancy, Mom, Nanny</p>
