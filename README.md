# odin-recipes
My Odin project repo
I am giong to build a basic recipe website consisting
of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes using relative links.

I have decided to do a full replica of my grandmothers cookbook for this project
I will be making about 200+ pages and having them intertiwine for ease of access using relative links
I will take photos of the cookbook she made before passing and scan the text off then add it into the code.

Love you Nanny ty for your example and love you put into us!

For the structure of folders for organiziation I will be making a subfolder for each type of recipe and all the recipies will reside in there.

I will be making a selection/navigation subfolder with directories for each catagory of recipe (each recipe listed) 
I will aswell link relevent recipies together.
ex. tart filling with tarts

a recipe-select.html will be made so subcatagories can be choosen and it will lead to those lists. 

template.html will be in each folder as a ex of what each site in that catagory will look like.
