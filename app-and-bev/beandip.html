    <h2>Bean Dip</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>4 bacon slices</strong></li>
        <li><strong>fried and crumbled 15 oz. refried beans (Little Panchos preferred)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1/4 tsp. garlic salt to taste</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1/8 tsp. lemon pepper to taste</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 whole jalapeño pepper</strong></li>
        <li><strong>crushed 1/2 c. grated cheddar cheese</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>Fry bacon in small skillet. When crisp, drain bacon on a paper towel, reserving grease, and crumble bacon when cool to the touch. Place bacon crumbles and grease in crockpot with beans, garlic salt, lemon pepper, pepper and cheese. Mix. Warm in crockpot for several hours. It's delicious. Serve with tortilla chips.</p>
